Modified fonts

UmePlus
UmePlus fonts are modified Ume and M+ fonts for Japanese.



UmePlus CL
UmePlus CL fonts are modified Ume CL and M+ fonts for Japanese.



MMCedar
MMCedar are combined fonts that use Motoya L Cedar and M+ fonts. Motoya L Cedar lacks some characters, so I generated the fonts.



Meguri
Meguri fonts are modified IPA and M+ fonts for Japanese.



Komatuna
Komatuna fonts are modified Konatu and M+ fonts for Japanese.


Monapo
Most Japanese websites were designed for “MS P Gothic” font. “Monapo” font is a combined font that uses ipagp.ttf and mona.ttf. It has almost same width as MS P Gothic, so it can show Japanese Ascii Art properly.
